# Html Function Plotter
for drawing and playing around with graphs. Currently only includes one for
drawing those hair-vector line fields. Each graph plotter is a single
html file with the necessary vanilla javascript baked right into it, that is
one canvas div element and after that simple javascript for drawing to said
canvas. These plotters exist mainly for me to build up intuition on math
concepts I come across, it isn't really meant to be used by other people,
but if you do decide to use this for whatever reason, go right ahead.
